Problem: An Academic Record should contain a list of all a Students grades, using generics.

Please work on this problem in preparation for the in-class CA:

1.Create a Subject class that takes as its data members a module name, and a grade for that module for example, “Data Structures”, 70.5
Create a simple App class that tests the output of the Subject class, using the appropriate toString method.

2. Create a Node that is capable of representing a student’s Academic Record. This Node class should contain an instance of Subject as its “element” along with the relevant pointer to the next node (T).

3. Construct a new Single LinkedList that uses this Node. Adding a number of subjects into a LinkedList forms an Academic Record. The LinkedList class should contain the following methods:

Reference to first and last Nodes


isEmpty – this method should check if the linkedlist is empty


size – this method should return the number of nodes within the linkedlist


get_average – this method should return the average score of the academic subjects within the linkedlist


add - this method should allow the addition of a new Node into the linkedlist at the end of the current list –
	public void add(Subject module)


remove - this method removes the first occurrence of the target Node from the linkedlist. The target is defined by Subject name  -
			public String remove(String target)
