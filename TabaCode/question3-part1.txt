Text editors are great at helping you write documents, Latex is one such application. They can do syntax
highlighting and make sure that you have properly closed of a “\begin” tag with an “\end” tag.”
Develop and implement a data structure as described below for the implementation of a validator that is
capable of text file containing a series (at least 3 nested levels of \begin-\end tags) to check if each open
\begin tag has a corresponding closing \end tag.
